# SelfDrivingCar
Hi, thanks for checking out my repo.
This project is focused on building a self-driving car from scratch.  I am a high-school student who loves electronics, python and 3D printing.

Goals:
 - âœ…Desing (CAD, electronics)
 - âœ…Buy Hardware
 - âœ…3D print
 - âœ…Assemble
 - âœ…Write hardware controllers
 - âœ…Make the car remote controlled through PC first
 - ðŸš§ [IN PROGGRESS] Create and Neural network to control the car using camera input only
 
Please consider staring! This is an ongoing project I will make everything pretty later ;)
